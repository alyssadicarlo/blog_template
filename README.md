# Blog Template

This blog template was built using HTML & CSS. It is not yet responsive as this was an exercise done in the DigitalCrafts bootcamp before learning media queries and responsiveness. This site can be viewed at [alyssadicarlo.github.io/blog_template/](https://alyssadicarlo.github.io/blog_template/) on a laptop or desktop.
